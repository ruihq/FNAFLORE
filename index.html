  <h1>The Five Nights at Freddy's Lore</h1>

  <h2>Fredbear's Family Diner</h2>
  <p>In 1967, William Afton and Henry opened Fredbear's Family Diner, featuring a brown furry bear mascot named Fredbear. They faced initial struggles but eventually found success with the introduction of a new mascot, a yellow rabbit suit called Bonnie.</p>

  <h2>Freddy Fazbear's Pizza</h2>
  <p>In 1973, a company bought Fredbear's Family Diner and opened Freddy Fazbear's Pizza as a franchise. William and Henry sold the diner but felt betrayed by the company's actions. William, known as the Purple Guy, sought revenge and began a series of heinous acts.</p>

  <h2>The Missing Children Incident</h2>
  <p>In 1980, using the Spring Bonnie suit, William lured and murdered five children, hiding their bodies inside the animatronics. The spirits of the children haunted the animatronics, seeking revenge on any adults they encountered, believing them to be the Purple Guy.</p>

  <h2>The Bite of '83</h2>
  <p>In 1983, an incident known as the Bite of '83 occurred when William's son witnessed his sister's death caused by one of the animatronics. This led to the cancellation of the planned Circus Baby's Pizza World and William's divorce.</p>

  <h2>The Rise and Fall of Fazbear Entertainment</h2>
  <p>In 1987, another Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location opened but faced various problems, including the animatronic Mangle biting someone. The company temporarily shut down but reopened later. Meanwhile, William continued his dark deeds, causing the deaths of more children.</p>

  <h2>William's Revenge and Afton Robotics</h2>
  <p>After realizing the devastation he had caused, William planned to fix his mistakes by manipulating his son, Michael, to undo the damage he had done. This led to the events at Circus Baby's Pizza World and subsequent encounters with various animatronics.</p>

  <h2>The Souls Freed</h2>
  <p>Michael, under the name Mike Schmidt, worked at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza to free the spirits of the children. With the help of his brother's spirit and the dismantling of the animatronics, he achieved this goal but sacrificed himself in the process.</p>

  <h2>The Future</h2>
  <p>After the events of FNAF 3 and the burning down of Fazbear's Fright, Michael's last objective is to confront his father, William Afton, for all the suffering he caused. The future of the FNAF story will be revealed in FNAF 6.</p>
